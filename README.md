Use the main_call.m script with input path to the directories 'entered as a string' of 
Completed Submissions directory that has already been shared.

NOTE : Please add all the directories in this repository as path in matlab for the 'main_call' script to function.

The script will run the entire calculation of Dice and ICC from scratch and visualize them in Violin Plots for Inter-Scanner,
Intra-Scanner and Intra-Session Analysis.

Second part of the script will generate the median of the top five submissions from the leaderboard across both scanner A
and scanner B. The generated visual tracts will be saved as pngs in the operating directory.
